'Eve' in this case is a malicious adversary able to read, modify, inject and delete data sent between Alice and Bob

## Goals of Cryptography

1) **Confidentiality**: keeping data secret from all but those authorized to see it. Done via encryption
2) **Data Integrity - Authentication**: Ensuring data has not been altered by unauthorized means
3) **Data origin authentication - Authentication**: Corroborating the source of the data.
4) **Non-repudiation**: Preventing an entity from denying previous commitments or actions.
